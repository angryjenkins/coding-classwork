Steps to "learn" a new language in 24 hours. 

0a. Figure out a programming language you want to learn. And why you think it's worth your time. Is it for a job? Is it for fun?

0b. At a high-level what can the programming language do? 

0c. Get a good book. Highly recommend Safari books

1. Figure out the build system. 
	-> Is it a compiled language or a language that can just 
	-> Is it an interpreted language (one that needs to be converted)

2. What tools do we need to build a simple application?
	
	-> IDE? 
	-> Sublime?
	-> How do we actually run a simple application?
	-> Get downloading

3. How do we get Hello World to Work? How do we actually "run" code?
	-> i.e. find sample code... Copy it in then try running it.
	-> Try breaking it down

4. Does the code need a main process? (like a main function everything goes through?)... If so what does that look like?
- no

5. How do variables work in the language? Are there different types of variables? (ints, floats, strings?) Are there different modifiers like public and private? Is there a difference between single and double quotes?
- variables do not have to be declared, but inputs do.

6. How do I make a comment?
- #

7. How do we log something to the screen? (What is the equivalent of console.log)

8. How do we create a for or while loop? (Then immediately test it by console logging a counter)

9. How do we create an if/else or a case/switch statement to handle conditionals?

10. How forgiving is the code when it comes to semicolons and the like? 

11. How do we create arrays? Can arrays be expanded? Are there alternatives to arrays like lists and dictionaries?

12. How do we create a function? (How do we pass in arguments? How do we return stuff?) How do we then call that function? Can we call a function before it's created? Does the order of the function matter? (Like can we call call a function that exists after our code?)

13. How do we create objects? Are there "classes" in the language?

14. How do we recall methods associated with those objects?

14. How do we take in command line input?

15. How do we import from external libraries?

16. How do we get our stuff to the web or visual?
