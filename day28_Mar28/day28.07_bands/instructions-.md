* Make a JavaScript file called bands.js that exports an object of music genres and bands like this:

```
{
	punk: 'Green Day',
	rap: 'Run DMC', 
	classic: 'Led Zeppelin'
}
```

* Require this JavaScript file into run.js and loop over the values and console.log them. 

* Make sure the program runs properly in the terminal like this:
```
node run.js
```

* That command in the terminal would output

```
a punk band is Green Day
a rap band is Run DMC
a classic band is Led Zeppelin
```

* Bonus: Make it so that your program takes in a parameter lke 'classic' and then outputs the associated band with it. In this case Led Zeppelin. 

* If no parameter is passed then loop over and output all of them like asked above.
