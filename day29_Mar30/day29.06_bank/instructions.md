Create bank.txt and add this in:

1, 2.33, 4.23, -2


Make a command line node app called bank.js that will do the following:

node bank.js total
this outputs the total you have in your bank account:

node bank.js deposit 4.4
this deposits 4.4 in so bank.txt gets 4.4 appended to the list

node bank.js withdraw 3.2
this withdraws 4.4 from the bank.txt file


Bonus:

node bank.js lotto
this withdraws .25 from the bank.txt file, but gives a 10% chance of a free deposit of 2
