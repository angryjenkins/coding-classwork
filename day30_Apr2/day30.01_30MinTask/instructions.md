Write a command line node app get_sums_of_all_ints_except_at_index.js() that takes a list of integers and returns a list of the sums. Do not use subtraction in your solution.
For example, given:

[1, 7, 3, 4]

your function would return:

[14, 8, 12, 11]

by calculating:

[7+3+4, 1+3+4, 1+7+4, 1+7+3]
