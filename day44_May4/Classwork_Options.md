Days instructions.
Today is all about getting caught up. No more confused faces. No. more "I'll get this eventually." Today's the day you see the big picture and gain a bit more confidence.

You have 1 of 3 Options to complete with your group. (edited)

1. Take the solution to last class' star wars activity and rebuild it from scratch line by line. (using the solution as a reference.) Make sure you can explain it to one another! (don't worry about the handlebars part for now. Use the non handlebars solution.) (edited)

2. Take any existing node and Express app weve done and back it up with a sql database
(ex: friend finder, hot restaurant, bamazon, train time.)

3. Challenge activity: if you feel comfortable with what's been covered talk to @faisal (and ahmed  when he arrives for a new activity) (edited)

Super Important Required Task for all: Draw out in diagram form how all the files in your express application are connected. Be creative! Then take a photo with your phone and slack it to the class. I want complete certainty that each of you can explain routing, the html files that get rendered, the server etc.
